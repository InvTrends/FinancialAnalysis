Trendfollowers use a disciplined technical analysis approach to ride the up and down trends of a given market. It is a charting algorithm that reduces risk by not targeting the bottom or peak of the equity, but by focusing on the middle part of the trends. These trends can last a few days to a few months. Short sellers, on the other hand, use fundamental analysis to identify companies that are prone to fail and short those stocks. Their return, as with Hedge Fund managers, can be large, but can take years to materialize. It is also risky due to market behaviors, such as institutional biases, an overly long bullish sentiment,  and a short squeeze. Many books have been written that have analyzed such phenomenon in markets and equities of the past. It is our intent to back-test such case histories with the help of AI, with the goal to extract rules that can aid in identifying such entities and in providing more reliable entry and exit points for buy and sell orders. 

Here is a set of references with such case histories and authoratative and insightful analysis that provide the baseline for our effort here:
